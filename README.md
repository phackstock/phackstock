### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* I am a research software engineer and data steward working at IIASA.
  * As a software engineer I'm working on:
    * [nomenclature](https://github.com/iamconsortium/nomenclature) package for integrated assessment modeling data validation and processing
    * [common-definitions](https://github.com/iamconsortium/common-definitions), an effort to estabilsh a common set terms used in integrated assessment modeling
    * Scenario processing and CI/CD for the IIASA Scenario Explorer 
  * As a data steward, I'm making sure that data sets and software are stored according to the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). 
* I have a background in physics and did my [master's thesis](https://repositum.tuwien.at/handle/20.500.12708/1300) at CERN working on antimatter research.
* When I'm not writing code you can usually find me in the moutains, ski touring, hiking and climbing
